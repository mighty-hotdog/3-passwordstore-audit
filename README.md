# PasswordStore

This is my 1st learning audit conducted on a mock smart contract application `Password Store`. This app allows a user to store a private password and retrieve it later. The user may also set a new password. The password is protected from access by other users who are not able to access it.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`

## Git

There are 2 branches. The `main` branch contains the onboarded client material. The `audit` branch contains the audit stuff and final report.

The libraries listed in this repo are irrelevant. They are not needed in the codebase.

## Quickstart

This is my 1st learning code audit. On a mock app. 

You don't want to clone this.

# Usage

## Deploy (local)

1. Start a local node

```
make anvil

2. Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy
```

## Testing

```
forge test
```

### Test Coverage

```
forge coverage
```

and for coverage based testing: 

```
